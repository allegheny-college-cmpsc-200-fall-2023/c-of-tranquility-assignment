# C of Tranquility: General report

This week's work introduced:

* basic rules and syntax of the `C` language
* `.dis` files, which contain "disassembled" programs, and how to read them
* peculiar behaviors of iteration and memory

Respond to the following prompts about the programs illustrating these concepts.

## What relationship do `.dis` files have to our `C` programs? Why do they exist?

`TODO`

## What does it mean when we say that `C` is _strongly typed_? Provide an example of typed variable below and its impact on memory.

```c
// TODO
```

## We described several key differences between `Python`, `C`, and `Assembly` programs. Choose one additional difference (not strong typing) and describe _what_ it is and why it's significant.

`TODO`

## Describe the concept of "bounds checking." Why is it significant?

`TODO`

## Our work involves compiled, versus interpreted programs. Speculate: why are we so interested in compiled binaries? What does the compilation (and/or disassembly) process teach us about computational systems?
